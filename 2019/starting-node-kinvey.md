# Getting Started with Node & Kinvey
This is a quick post to help you get up and running with a new Node project connected to a Kinvey backend. Let's just jump right in!

## Creating a Node Project
I make a lot of Node projects, some even see the light of day ðŸ˜› so I have a script to spin one up. I got the idea from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/bitandbang/status/1082331715471925250) from [Tierney Cyren](https://twitter.com/bitandbang/) and learned even more from [this post](https://philna.sh/blog/2019/01/10/how-to-start-a-node-js-project/) by [Phil Nash](https://twitter.com/philnash).

As the tweet says, in your terminal you can just type:

```
npx license mit > LICENSE
npx gitignore node
npx covgen <your email address>
npm init -y
```




## Connecting to Kinvey
Now that we have out base project we get to connect it to our Kinvey backend.

## Next Steps
We're all setup! Pretty easy, right? What will we do next, such possibilities. Here are some great resources to help you on your coding journey:
