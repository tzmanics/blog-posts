# What is a Microapp?

Although you may see more articles on micrapps popping up recently, the term and development strategy has been around for some time. The first search result for microapps was an [article on 'Micro Apps' from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2015/07/16/what-are-micro-apps-and-why-do-they-matter-for-mobile/#1860a2786338) in 2015. The author even predicted that soon they may even be commonly referred to with the single word: microapp. Modern-day Nostradamus, I tell ya üòâ. So, what _is_ a microapp?

*A microapp is an app that is highly focused on performing just one task.*

In software engineering terms, this is akin to [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) which states that, "a class should have one and only one reason to change." In other words, it only has one job and it, hopefully, does it well. Instead of having an app that has every task an employee _can_ do (e.g. report time off, submit expenses, choose benefits, search employee directory, upload shared resources, etc.) there are microapps that handle each of those tasks specifically.

As consumers, we've been using microapps for a while: the flight search box in Google, calendar alerts on desktop, WeCha, and so many more.

Yet, you may not know too much about what they are, I'm just learning about them this year. To save you some time, here are the 4 top things I've learned about microapps:

- They reduce complexity for developers and users.
- Microapps are not the same as microservices but the benefits are.
- With microapps, more is less but more is also more. (So deep, I know.)
- Creating a microapp is fast and easy.

If that's enough info for you, awesome üëç. If not, let me dig in a little deeper to each point.

## Reducing Complexity for Developers and Users
Microapps help you breakdown your apps into consumable pieces for both the developers and the users.
- customizing applications to what users need to do
- not having to worry about the chain of permissions/auths as users navigatr thru an app.
- most users don't use all of the applications but have to learn to navigate to the parts they need, etc.
-  more focused and targetted "highly focused, task-based functionality" get in and interact with a low-barrier
- simple, without a lot of features making them easier to use and therefore more appealing to the people using them
- employe engagement and productivity increases when it's easy to carry out the task at hand
- make it so employees can easily carry out a task, remove steps they may take out of confusion (emailing someone for help with reimbursements, pinging the support team to submit a customer complaint) remove the "middleman"
- developers don't have to worry about using different frameworks

## Microapps vs. Microservices
- you can concentrate on the specific UI for a certain user, doing a function
- application maintenance is much easier when there are fewer moving parts
- technical debt has a tendency to pile up when you're staring at a massive monolithic app, it's more consumable when the project is broken down?
- updating or killing a project isn't as big of an undertaking

## Less is More && More is More
- you can have the base application and the parts that you re-use and put together in different configurataions that work for a certain application. That way you're not constantly re-writing the same applications. This keeps things consitent
- shorter development time means you can make more apps that are more specific to a users needs

## Fast & Easy to Create
- be more proficient, impactful and intentional with your development time, more is needed but the resources aren't there
- when the development process is simplified more people are able to take on the task of building out microapps
- changes are easy to deploy because they are delivered as instant updates through the microapp container
