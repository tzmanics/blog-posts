# Gif Guide: Authentication using Firebase in an Angular App

We're going to be building on top of the project created that already has the kenod ui defualt theme styling and kendo ui graph implemented.

In order to use firebase, make sure you already have `typings` & `typescript` installed globally (`-g`).
