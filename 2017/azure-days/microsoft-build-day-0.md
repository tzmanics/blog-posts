# Gif Guide: Microsoft Build - Day 0
## Zero to Serverless, Women in Business & Technology Reception & Progress Party

I was very fortunate to be able to attend Microsoft Build this year. Although I had heard a lot about Build and watched many sessions from past Builds, I didn't really know what to expect. I decided to walk you through my experience and all the new fun I found üòä

### Serverless in Azure Zero to Hero + Office Hours with Azure Functions & Logic App Team

The day before Build started (Day 0) we had the option to attend a few workshops: Microsoft AI Immersion Workshop, Build Better Business Apps and Processes with Office 365, Azure Pre-Days (Container Fest, Serverless in Azure Zero to Hero + Office Hours with Azure Functions or Logic App Team Azure IoT Hackathon) or Visual Studio Extensibility Workshop. I had played around with deploying my Node and Angular apps on Azure, so I thought I would learn more.

The workshop was held at Bell Harbour International Conference Center right on the water. I had never been to Seattle before but it has been sunny and warm everyday. I'm starting to think that everyone who lives in Seattle is just spreading a rumour that it is always rainy and gray just to keep this amazing place to themselves üòè They fed and cofee'ed us then lead us to our workshop rooms.

After Project Manager, Chris Anderson, made it through an adventure with a brand new Lyft driver to get to the workshop he introduced us to the path that lead his team to Serverless. // started with web jobs, getting on premise, iaas, saas.

They started looking into the abstractions of servers. Instead of a certain number of servers waiting there they spin up and scale down based on events. This isn't just looking into capacity of a server or response time but actual inputs in the queue to see to predict activity. So, yes, serverless is a pretty silly name because we are still using servers. Maybe server-waste-less is more appropriate üòèThe Azure team was nice enough to talk through this with me at the office hours that took place all day and at lunch. Even in such a stressful time as releasing your core product at Build the team was really nice and all seemed to enjoy each others company too ‚ô•Ô∏è

Functions

Functions can be created in C#, JavaScript and even F# for all you data scientists out there (and those that just like f# because).

Pre-made Functions
There is a library of pre-made functions available for you to use immediately. This includes useful things like webhooks+ APIs, timers, data processing and more. // check out the list in the azure portal (maybe post an image of it)

Dependent on what kind of functions you are creating, you can get a hefty bill if you don't pay attention. To avoid this Chris pointed out that you can set a daily usage quota so that you don't have to pay for your functions. This was crucial for the function that Chris Andersen built to test, which would spin up a function whenever a function was spun up. You can imagine how crazy that could get but he did have a cap. // Look into what exactly he did in the Channel 9 interview.

Next, Jeff Hollan, took the stage to talk about Microsoft's Logic App Tooling. Now, I'm not the biggest fan of guis but I have to admit that Logic Apps looked pretty dang useful. Microsoft's Logic Apps have over 125+ connectors, not just to Microsoft services, although they are connected to A LOT of Microsoft services. This means you can make a pretty robust application and it is fast. To demo it, Jeff loaded up a CSV of contacts, clicked to add the service to parse the csv to json, then loop over the objects using forEach and finally a service that would get the values from the corresponding keys to send an email to each contact. This is something I would definitely need: grab my new contacts that signed up for a mailing list and email them their welcome message. It took him under 7 minutes to do this.

The way Jeff described it was that the Logic App connectors act as the connective tissue between all of the different services. This also includes Microsoft's new congnitive services. You can also use on-premises data gateway (sql, sao, etc.). Once your logic app is setup you can deploy it using your azure dashboard.


* Side note: Jeff used this awesome app called Zoom It that Mark // made. I would like to humbly request a Mac version, please!

Next on stage was, Donna Malayeri, to talk about Azure Functions Local Development. Now, disclaimer, I haven't used an IDE since I was coding in Java & I don't miss it! BUT watching Donna smoothly deal with bad connections and live debugging showed me a lot of what [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/whatsnew/) has to offer. Donna is also really smart and knows her products really well sooooo that also has something to do with my impression.

She also talked about the Azure Functions Core Tools (formerly known as Prince, I mean as the Azure Functions CLI) which can be installed via npm [see here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-functions-core-tools). Currently this package only "works on Windows, since the underlying Functions Host is not yet cross-platform." There is [an issue on Github](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-cli/issues/13) that you can up-vote so us Mac users can get in on the fun too üëç

I had to step away from the workshop to team up with Brian Rinaldi to convince our lovely co-workers, Burke Holland adn TJ Van Toll, that PWA's are awesome. You can check out how that when down in our [Slack Chat article](http://developer.telerik.com/topics/web-development/progressive-web-apps-yeh-meh/).


## Coding Time
When we got back from lunch we were able to dive into some code thanks to two tutorials that the team made for us. I jumped into [the Node one](https://github.com/christopheranderson/squirebot). Since I wasn't able to take advantage of the Azure functions CLI, I ended up deplo:w
