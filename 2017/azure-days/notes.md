# Chris Anderson - Functions

started with web jobs
getting on premises
iaas
sass

first you look in to the abstraction of servers
since servers aren't just waiting there for you they look to events to see when to scale

was looking at memory and cpu but then you can't look ahead of time
can see patterns in scaling instead

?? you said there are patterns with events and that you don't rely on memory and cpu but what patterns can you track for instances like build where your site gets hit a ton?

## premade function
webhooks + API
timer
data processing

these can be in either c# JS or f#

can set daily usage quota so you don't have to pay for your functions
