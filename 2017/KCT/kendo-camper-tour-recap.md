# Kendo Camper Tour Recap

This summer I was lucky enough to be able to drive my camper to the West Coast to hang out with a bunch of awesome user groups and talk about our Kendo UI library! A week before leaving, I purchased a 1977 Apache Ramada solid state popup, picked up my 11-year old pomeranian, Toshmagosh, and hit the road.

*Can you tell just _how_ excited Toshi is??*

I drove from Ohio to my first stop in San Francisco in 5 days. There were so many stops along the way that I was excited to see but had not realized just how awe-inspiring they would be.

Although the sites I passed were amazing, by far, my favorite part was meeting so many awesome organizers, creators and members of all the user groups I got to hang out with. I've been working to build up my community in Cincinnati, OH, helping start and run 2 user groups (Cincy Women Who Code & NodeSchool Cincy) as well as support many other groups. It was great to meet people on the West Coast who were actively creating fantastic spaces and events for everyone in their communities.

## The Kendo Camper Tour Project: U Go Hue Go
Working as a developer advocate means not only making resources and working with developers to make using Kendo UI easier but also really knowing how to incorporate our libraries with other awesome technologies. I decided to make a project I could progressively work on and speak about while on the Kendo Camper Tour. The project, deemed 'U Go Hue Go', uses the Angular CLI, Kendo UI for Angular, the Philips Hue API & lights as well as Node to talk to the Hue API. I also decided to make this app into a Progressive Web App which lets me make a great mobile experience and allows my web app to be more reliable when the network is weak or unavailable. I'll have a blog post talking all about this project (coming soon) but this is what I based all of my talks on while on this tour.

## The Journey
To start the trip I had to actually make my way over to California. After a quick stop in Minneapolis to see some friends I found my way across the continent taking a less-direct route in order to see some amazingly beautiful sites in the US. In total I stopped at (big breath in üòÆ): Minneapolis, MN, Horse Thief Lake Campground, SD, Mt. Timanogos, UT, Winnemucca RV Park, NV and Sunset Campground, CA. Have you ever worked/coded in a car for 10 hours? I do _not_ recommend it. In this case it was definitely more about the day's destination, NOT the journey üòõ

## WaffleJS
Finally, it was time for my first user group meeting and I couldn't be more stoked that I was kicking off the tour at WaffleJS! I had heard about WaffleJS a while back when I attended Node Adventure at Walker Creek Ranch in 2015. WaffleJS isn't just known for having great speakers and performers but also for the karaoke after-party. Due to Cavaliers/Golden State Warriors game (we don't need to talk about those results üò¨) the venue was moved from SOMA StrEAT Food Park to the DNA Lounge. While I was hanging out, eating pizza before the meetup I was able to get onto their WIFI and make my Philips light system work. This was very exciting for the workers and me.

The event did not disappoint! The organizers were fun, welcoming and oh, so entertaining. I learned a lot, met amazing people and saw some of the best karaoke I think I've ever witnessed.

## Sacramento GDG
Before making my way out to California, I had reached out to Alain Chautard of the Sacramento GDG group and snagged a speaking spot at their June meetup. The organizers gave a really great recap of their trip to the GDG organizer summit and Google IO. We then went through as I live-coded creating an Angular app using th Angular CLI and adding some Kendo UI components to control the Philips Hue lights. I had never been to Sacramento before but if I presume everyone is like the members of the user group, Sacramento is filled with nice people that have great, intellectual questions üëå‚òëÔ∏èüòÅ

## Remote Workspace: El Dorado National Forest
After Sacramento GDG I had some time before my next user group stop so I settled in at El Dorado National Forest to do more work on the project and catch up on my regular daily work tasks. But there was one thing that I did not remember to prepare for on my Summer trip to the West Coast: ‚ùÑSNOW!‚ùÑ

![snowy drive]()
*An unexpected winter wonderland.*

Thankfully, there was a really quaint town a short drive away that had a an awesome coffee shop with WiFi and delicious food, as well as an army surplus store selling thermals and warm socks!

## Angular SF
The snow ended just in time for me to head back to SF for the AngularSF meetup! I was hoping to attend both Angular Mountain View _and_ AngularSF but they fel on the same day and I don't have those time travel skills yet ([quantum entanglement](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/physics/scientists-generate-quantum-entanglement-in-space-for-the-first-time/)) is cool and all but let's quicken the pace, scientists!). This year at ngConf I got to meet [Minko Gechev](https://twitter.com/mgechev) and he saved me a spot to speak at AngularSF. We had a great meetup with a presentation from Austin Green and Brett Lazarus on Automated API model enforcement with Swagger and TypeScript. We had the event at the Delphix offices then all got to hand out more down the street for a bit.

## The Journey through Endor
After AngularSF, it was time to say goodbye to San Francisco and make my way through California and up into Oregon. While I was in California I stayed at some really beautiful national parks. In order to have a WiFi connection for work, I stayed at some RV parks too (side note: a lot of the national parks had decent LTS connection so you can tether your laptop to your cell phone for internet). If you are a remote worker, I highly recommend camper/rv life. A lot of sites are really wonderful and everyone I met was very friendly. One of my **favorite** adventures was when I got to walk through Endor, ummm, I mean, Tall Trees Redwood Grove located in the Redwood National & State Park. I even brought the camper in üòâ.

*It was a wild ride!*

## DonutJS
After a quick stop at Deschutes Brewery in Bend, Oregon it was time to head up to Portland for DonutJS!

![Toshi at Deschutes]()
*don't worry, she never actually reached the glass (sad Toshi)*

Like WaffleJS, I had known about DonutJS since hearing about it through the Node community. Everything about DonutJS was awesome from the organizers and venue, to the super entertaining talks and the killer combinations of donuts and coconut sparkling water.

I ran into Craig Dennis and James Churchill from Treehouse who reminded me of just how small and awesome our world it. It turns Craig had my old co-workers do a talk for their IoT workshop and ... had just went to dinner with my new co-workers at Codeapalousa! Plus, I got to see a buddy I hadn't seen since Node Interactive 16' who introduced by to some really great dystopian authors. I so ‚ô•Ô∏è tech communities.

## Portland JavaScript Admirers 
I found the Portland Javascript Admirers group and was immediately intrigued. "I _also_ admire JavaScriptüò≤! Can we hang out?" Janrain hosted the meetup in their office building and it was one of the most interesting spaces I've seen thus far. Before I spoke, [Phillip Kerman](https://twitter.com/phillip) did a presentation on functional programming. After my talk I got to talk shop, electronics and campers with the organizers and some of the local developers. It turned out one of the attendees had actually owned the same model of camper that I was in now when he was growing up. So cool!

## Angular PDX & Women Who Code PDX
Another awesome person I got to meet at ngConf this year was Sam Julien. He had seen a thread on the Angular PDX Meetup page where I was trying to get a hold of them to speak at their meetup. But who needs old-fashioned emails when you have ngConf to see each other in-person?!

At yet another amazing conference, Node Interactive in Portland, I met Caterina Paun through our Women Who Code community. We had a great time hanging out and I even attended one of their awesome Women Who Code meetups while I was in town for Node Interactive. I knew I definitely wanted to reach out to her to see if there was a way to me to work with her & WWCPDX while I was in town.

So, 'with our powers combined', we had an awesome joint meetup with ngPDX and WWCPDX together! It was great having both communities come together to learn and socialize. The CDK Global                                                               

## JavaScript Workshop
I decided to reach out to the JavaScript Workshop group to see if they may need a lightning talk to accompany their awesome talk by Sara ... that they already had lined up. Their organizer, ..., had great questions and feedback throughout the meetup.

## SeattleJS
When I was in Seattle for Microsoft Build this year I got to meet a few of the awesome organizers of SeattleJS. This month their meetup was hosted at Redfin in their awesome offices downtown. 

## Angular Seattle
For the very last stop on the Kendo Camper Tour I got to speak at Angular Seattle. I ran into Mikeal Morland at ngConf this year (isn't ngConf awesome?!) at an Angular Community meeting. Michael, Craig and Mike are building the Angular community back up in Seattle and kicked it off with an Intro to Angular session and ICE CREAM üç¶!
