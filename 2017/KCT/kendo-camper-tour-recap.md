# Kendo Camper Tour Recap

This summer I was lucky enough to be able to drive my camper to the West Coast and hang out with a bunch of awesome user groups! This June, I purchased a 1977 Apache Ramada solid state popup, picked up my 11-year old pomeranian, Toshmagosh, and hit the road.

## The Journey
To start the trip I had to actually make my way over to California. After a quick stop in Minneapolis to see some friends I found my way across the contenant taking a less-direct route in order to see some amazingly beautiful sites in the US. 

## WaffleJS
I had heard about WaffleJS a while back when I attended Node Adenture at Walker Creek Ranch in 2015. WaffleJS isn't just known for having great speakers and performers but also for the karaoke after-party. Due to Cavaliers/ game (we don't need to talk aobut the results üò¨) the venue was moved from StrEAT ... to the DNA Lounge. While I was hanging out, eating pizza before the meetup I was able to get onto their WIFI and make my Philips light system work. This was very exciting for the workers and me.

## Sacramento GDG
Before making my way out to California I had reached out to the Sacramento GDG group and snagged a speaking spot at their June meetup. The organizers gave a quick recap of their trip to the GDG organizer summit and Google IO. 

## Remote Workspace: El Dorado National Forest
After Sacramento GDG I had some time before my next user group stop so I settled in at El Dorado National Forest to do more work on the project and catch up on my regular daily work tasks. But there was one thing that I did not remember to prepare for on my Summer trip to the West Coast: ‚ùÑSNOW!‚ùÑ

Thankfully, there was a really quaint town a short drive away that had a an awesome coffee shop with WiFi and delicious food, as well as an army surplus store selling thermals and warm socks!

## Angular SF
This year at ngConf I got to meet Minko... 

## DonutJS
Like WaffleJS, I had known about DonutJS since hearing about it through the Node community. Everything about DonutJS was awesome from the organizers and venue, to the talks and the killer combinations of donuts and coconut sparkling water.

I ran into Craig and ... from Treehouse who reminded me of just how small and awesome our world it. It turns Craig had my old co-workers do a talk for their IoT workshop and ... had just went to dinner with my new co-workers at Codeapalousa! I so ‚ô•Ô∏è tech comminities. 

## Portland JavaScript Admirers 
I found the Javascript Admirers of Portland group and was immediately intrigued. "I _also_ admire JavaScriptüò≤! Can we hang out?" ... hosted the meetup in their office building and it was one of the most interesting spaces I've seen thus far. Before I spoke, ... did a presentation on Functional Programming with JavaScript.

## Angular PDX & Women Who Code PDX
Another awesome person I got to meet at ngConf this year was Sam Julien. 

## JavaScript Workshop
I decided to reach out to the JavaScript Workshop group to see if they may need a lightning talk to accompany their awesome talk by Sara ... that they already had lined up. Their organizer, ..., had great questions and feedback throughout the meetup.

## SeattleJS
When I was in Seattle for Microsoft Build this year I got to meet a few of the awesome organizers of SeattleJS. This month their meetup was hosted at Redfin in their awesome offices downtown. 

## Angular Seattle
For the very last stop on the Kendo Camper Tour I got to speak at Angular Seattle. I ran into Mikeal Morland at ngConf this year (isn't ngConf awesome?!) at an Angular Community meeting. Michael, Craig and Mike are building the Angular community back up in Seattle and kicked it off with an Intro to Angular session and ICE CREAM üç¶!
