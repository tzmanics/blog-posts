#Kendo Camper Tour
## Part 1: Setting up a Philips Hue to WIFI networks + 2,650 miles

- explain Kendo Camper Tour and give link to /tour
- explain project the parts and how it is going to evolve
- talk about why i chose hue
- go into the usual setup
- My situation is, obviously, not very usual...
- First, I will need to connect to a WIFI router. Once the computer is connected to WIFI you can plug an ethernet cable in and bridge those two connections so that the WiFi connection is fed to the ethernet. What's happening inside the computer may be way more complicated than I'm making it out to be, but let's keep things simple for now. Stay tuned for an in-depth look into what happens when you bridge an ethernet cable to your WiFi connection. Just kidding! Hope I didn't get anyone's hopes up ðŸ˜˜
- Once I knew this was a possibility I ran to the nearest Best Buy (in American Fork, UT) and bought a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter. Lo and behold ðŸŒ© you can NOT bridge on a Mac if the device you're trying to bridge to is wireless.
- Thankfully, my husband is not a Mac person AND his fancy computer (Lenovo W530 âœ¨) still has an ethernet port ðŸ˜². In the car, driving through the mountains I was able to plug the Hue bridge in to a power outlet, connect its ethernet to the laptop, connect to my our mobile hotspot and bridge the connections to give the Hue Bridge access to the internet. ðŸ’« TADA ðŸ’« 
- Couldn't actually get an IP from the bridge when using the movile hotspot.
- Our next camper home was in an RV park that had WIFI.
- Connected and was able to control the lights.
- I decided to try it at my next speaking venue, DNA Pizza.
- Now that I knew I could take the Hue Bridge connection my next step was to create the Angular application and the light's UI components.
