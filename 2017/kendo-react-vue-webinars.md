# Kendo UI Support for React & Vue Webinars

We are very excited to announce that our Kendo UI component library will now have support for React and Vue applications! This includes awesome UI components like our Date Picker, PanelBar, TabStrip, Grid and more. You can check out the whole list here: [React Components](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui#GeneralContent_C304_Col00), [Vue Components](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-vue-ui#GeneralContent_C304_Col00). As always, our components give you the ability to code more robust apps faster!

Now with one Kendo UI license you can have the support for Angular, jQuery, React and Vue. So, if you change or migrate to a new technology environment, you're covered. Along with the many resources we provide, like great [demos](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/) and the super handy [Theme Builder](http://themebuilder.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui), with these libraries you also get several different support options. When giving you the tools to build great with we want you to also have support you can count on.

## Come Check it Out!
We can only fit so much in a blog post so we decided to put on a webinar for you! Join us and we'll walk you through the easy setup and showcase a few awesome things the components can help you build. If you have any questions message us on Twitter at @KendoUI or with the hashtag #heyKendoUI and we can try to get them answered during the webinar.
