# Microsoft //Build & Google I/O: Keynote Comparison

Last year I was fortunate enough to attend both Microsoft //Build and Google I/O. I realized there were tons of similarities in the keynotes at each conference. At first this was surprising to me but I realized they are both focusing on the newest and greatest technologies, duh. Last year AI was recognizing everything and everyone, assistants were organizing our lives way better than we were and both camps were trying to make clouds, servers and machine learning more approachable.

## Main Overarching Concepts

## New Technologies

## Hey Alexa, Hey Cortana, Yo Google

## Human BEings!
