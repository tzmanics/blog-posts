# What Can Kendo UI Do For You

Hi! I'm Tara Manicsic, [tzmanics](https://twitter.com/Tzmanics) on Twitter and [GitHub](https://github.com/tzmanics). I am a developer advocate for [Progress](https://www.progress.com/) here to help guide you through the wonderful world of [Kendo UI built for React](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui). This is, sadly, the last post in this series connected to [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLGlTD7u3kMo1TKLmFShXMhP-fIculjOu). If this is the first post that you're seeing, you have gone backwards. You can continue to go backwards, but it will be very confusing and you will be undoing a lot of code. But, I am not here to judge. To each their own. If you would like to go in the correct order, all the post are listed below along with some resources including the [repo](https://github.com/tzmanics/kendoui-react-video-series) that we made for the project that we built using [Kendo UI React components](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components).

What will we be covering in this very last post? One, I will let you in on the secret of how we've actually been coding a [Progressive Web App](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/a-gentle-and-practical-introduction-to-progressive-web-apps) this whole time. Fun, right? Two, we will talk about all of the other components that there are inside of the React component library, including the ones built specifically for React, [true React components](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components), and the [React wrappers](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/#react-wrappers) that we have. There are a lot of them. Thirdly, we will look at more resources that you have at your disposal including [demos](https://www.telerik.com/support/demos), [blog posts](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/web), [forums](https://www.telerik.com/forums/kendo-ui-react) and more.

To get us rolling, let's talk about Progressive Web Apps, also known as PWAs. The project that we were working on was actually a PWA. I want to show you what files made it a PWA. If you're new to PWAs, basically they are a way to take advantage of modern web technologies to make your web application perform better, independent of your network connectivity. They also give you a way to make your applications more engaging and re-engaging to the user and give it an app-like feel. This is a very big topic that we won't be able to cover completely in this section, but you can learn more in [this fantastic blog post](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/a-gentle-and-practical-introduction-to-progressive-web-apps). I also linked one of my Progressive Web App talks [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QATVDJ1HvHY) you can check into that and there's a ton of [resources online](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/gif-guide-creating-a-progressive-web-app-react-kendo-ui) to learn more.

For now, I want to show you in the project that we created, what `create-react-app` gave us to make our app more PWA-y. Let's look back into the code. If we list out the files that are actually in our project, and go first into our `public` directory, you will see that there is a `manifest.json` file. And if we look inside of that, we see that it’s a key value pair JSON file.

```json
{
 "short_name": "React App",
 "name": "Create React App Sample",
 "icons": [
   {
     "src": "favicon.ico",
     "sizes": "64x64 32x32 24x24 16x16",
     "type": "image/x-icon"
   }
 ],
 "start_url": "./index.html",
 "display": "standalone",
 "theme_color": "#000000",
 "background_color": "#ffffff"
}
```

This is metadata that is given to your browser to say, "Hey, this is how you treat this application; this is how you display things." Let’s have a quick run through of each of these things that we have in this file in particular. The `short_name` is the name listed on a device if a user decides to download your application. One of the best things about the `short_name` that I always bring up in every single talk is that it supports emojis. The next thing is the `name`,  it's basically just the name of your application, how it’s identified. `icons` is the image representation your app with have on a user’s device. There are a lot of other options for choosing your icon, you can learn more [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest#icons). The create app only gives you one inside here but you can add more to the array. Your `start_url` basically tells the browser where to open the application when the user opens it from their device. The `display` value decides how you want the browser to display your application including the option for a fullscreen view using `standalone`. Next is the `theme_color` this is basically just matching the color of your search bars and your application presentation based on the browser. Finally, the `background_color` helps you control the transition between a user clicking yout icon to open the app and when the app opens. It can take some time to open the browser and load your resources, it may be a very short span but this lets the user know something is actually happening. That's your manifest.json in a very, very tiny nutshell. You can find more information on that this file [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/).

Next, I want to show you the other awesomeness that `create-react-app` has given to you: a `registerServiceWorker.js` file inside our `src` folder. Did you see it there while we were coding? This script registers the service worker file created to cache your local resources. Service workers can be very complicated because they can do a ton of stuff for you, but `create-react-app` gives you a quick setup to learn from. The best thing to remember it's JavaScript! It's event listeners, promises, `if` statements, all things you know. The file that you get in this project setup has a lot of comments to help guide you through what's actually happening.

A service worker is basically a JavaScript file that is running independent of your application. It's a proxy between your application and the network if the network is available. Basically, being like an old school phone operator that is saying, “The network isn't available, but there's information that I want to give to it when it is, so I'll cache it until the network is available again.” This is how push notifications work. The application isn't open, but they're subscribed to push notifications so a service worker can give you this information that the network is sending. Or when a user goes to open up your website again, if you have cached resources and they don't have a connection, say they're on an airplane, it still looks like your application is working because it’s serving up the cached resources. They have instant feedback and it loads super fast because it's in the cache. Again, very in depth topic that we will not fully cover all here. So check out the [Google’s developers page on service workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) to get a really great thorough understanding about service workers. If you want more information about progressive web apps in general, there's a great page on their site as well in their [web section on progressive web apps](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/).
Also, feel free to check out any of my talks and ping me about Progressive Web Apps because I think they're awesome and I love to talk about them.

Let's move on. The other thing I want to talk to you about in this video is the fact that we completely just skimmed the surface on the components that we could have used. I wanted to walk you through the documentation on these components so you could take a look at what there is. I feel like I'm constantly discovering new things. I would love to share with you a quick rundown. In this series we looked at just a few of the [true React components](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/#react-components) and only one of the [React wrapper components](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/#react-wrappers), but there are also a whole bunch of other React components. Another great feature is that in our documentation for each component, not only do you have all of the code, examples on how to put it into use and the API's, but we also give you live examples of what these components look like to give you an understanding of what you're going to see on your page. You can also open up the code to edit and play around with it to fully understand how it works.

I’ll quickly rundown a few of the other components to give you a taste of what we have. We discussed buttons, but they is  also the [`ButtonGroup`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/buttons/buttongroup/) which you to give you more options. I think [`DateInputs`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/dateinputs/) are super handy and people use them a ton. You are able to input dates and use your arrow keys to select a date. It knows which months have 28, 30 or 31 dates as well. It a nice way to scan through dates easily. The `DatePicker` also has smooth visual transitions. All of these UI/UX animations, these cues of interaction for the user, are all with the theme libraries. It’s nice to not have to think about those things, let alone take the time to code them out.

Okay, we talked about our grids and our inputs and our dropdowns. I also wanted to show you [`Datemath`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/datemath/). I love this because I am constantly scheduling events and having to use this type of math. I live by my calendar, as it seems many of us do. If you pick today's date and then you want to say, "Okay. Three weeks time, let's meet up." You just add three weeks and now you have your new date. Nifty right?

Next, let’s look into forms. How many forms do teams build? There are forms on everything! We made a little form on our project for this series, but we could have learned more using the [`forms`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/forms/getting-started/) guide we have in our components list. This is a great resource for developers. So I wanted to bring it to your attention 🤗.

Now, there is so much more inside of the React wrappers. Again, I just wanted to show you a few things that are very exciting and very popular. First of all, the [layout](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/wrappers/layout/). People use the layouts a lot, the [`Menu`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/wrappers/layout/menu/), [`PanelBar`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/wrappers/layout/panelbar/) and [`TabStrip`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/wrappers/layout/tabstrip/) to help with the layout of pages. This gives you interactions right out of the box to help you guide people through your page, to help them with navigation and menus throughout your page. This brings me to the [`TreeView`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/wrappers/treeview/). We have the `TreeView`, which gives lets you display hierarchical data in a traditional tree structure. It also supports user interaction through mouse or touch events and performs re-ordering operations by using the drag-and-drop functionality. We get questions about these a lot because people are using tree views in their websites. The other tree component we have is the [`TreeList`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/wrappers/treelist/) which lets you to display self-referencing tabular data and to sort, filter, and edit its data. The last thing I want to tell you about today is the [`Scheduler`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/wrappers/scheduler/). The `Scheduler` is one of the other components we get asked about a lot and I think it's super nifty. Again, scheduling is difficult and we want to help you with the tooling to make that easier for your users. The scheduler is really fantastic because not only can you get these different views of what the calendar looks like (daily, weekly, monthly), but then you can actually bring in the full calendar to take at your agenda then jump back to a specific day.

I want to jump from the components to the things that help you use the components. One of my favorites are our demos. With the demos in the [demo pages](https://www.telerik.com/support/demos), you can try the actual component inside working code and even copy and paste as you need. Just seeing and interacting with the code helps to know how to use the component and what the capabilities are of each component. It's a very, very handy resource that you can get a ton of mileage out of. Next up, one thing that I think is very handy is to get information from other people who are actually using the components using our [forums](https://www.telerik.com/forums/kendo-ui-react). This includes people who are actually on the Kendo UI team. This is where you can ask any questions, help other people out or even just have discussions about when to use what components or how people have gone about it in their projects. There are a lot of forum discussion rooms. When you go inside of the discussion rooms, you’ll see they are sorted out to help you go through by component. You’ll see there are many times admins comment in these rooms, we're active in these rooms because we want to be helpful.

Finally, I want to point you to our blog and video content. We have a bunch of [blog posts](http://www.telerik.com/blogs), both from people on the team and people from the community. The aim is to talk to you about different things that are happening with Kendo UI, with Progress products, in the React community and on the web. We try to keep you up to date with everything that's happening, all the options you have. The blog posts also contain tutorials on different ways of using our components. We're always open to suggestions for things that you want to learn about for blog posts as well. We're happy to abide, just let us know. One of my favorites resources, I may be biased, is our [Kendo UI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG-debAKyINSMrWnFz0w84A). This where you can, of course, find the videos for this blog series, but also a bunch of our release webinars. These webinars are here to guide you through all the new things that we are coming out with and that we have to offer.

Speaking of different things coming out, I want to remind you to check out our [Kendo UI website](http://kendoui.com/). We have all the information for all out different Kendo UI products. Another important information location is our [roadmap](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/roadmap). You can check up to see all the new things coming out and all the things that we have to offer. Okay, I feel like you are really ready to dive in and get going with your Kendo UI React projects. Remember that we are always here if you need help, if you need questions answered, or if you need to talk about what to make next. We are happy to help! You can reach out to us [@KendoUI](https://twitter.com/kendoui) on Twitter. You can reach out to me, personally, on Twitter [@tzmanics](https://twitter.com/tzmanics), my DMs are open. I really appreciate you joining me on this journey through our React  series. Thanks for coding with me and thanks for hanging out. Hopefully I will see you soon!
