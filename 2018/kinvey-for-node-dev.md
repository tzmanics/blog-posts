# Kinvey for Node Developers

## Intro

## Built _by_ Node Developers
Being Node developers helps us realize what is important for fellow Node developers. For instance, we recently made it so that you can use any LTS version of Node. You just chose the version you like and we install the latest patch of that major version.

We also know the value of the Node ecosystem. We have members of our team who have contributed to Node core and are active in the Node community. We also utilize the npm ecosystem with our Flex Services to make it easy for you to incorporate them into your projects.
